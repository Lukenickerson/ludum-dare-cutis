## Adding a Skin

1. Fork this project
1. Create a `.css` and `.js` for your skin. For the sake of consistency, 
please use the same name for both files, and use snake_case (lowercase and replace spaces with underscores).
1. Add a new skin into the `skins\` directory. Use the same name that matches your file names. 
(See current skins as examples)
1. Add your skin's name to the JSONP file: `skin_list.json.js`. 
`"base"` is the name of your directory and files; `"display"` is the human-friendly name
(can include spaces)
1. Wait for Luke to merge your changes or remind him on twitter @deathraygames
